# NVY BOT  

##  About

Nvy bot is a pure JavaScript Discord bot created using the Discord.js API.  Nvybot is the evolved and public version of Incredibot that I created for personal use back in March of 2017 but never finished coding. 

## Why 

I began working on Incredibot because at the time there were a bunch of bots that had a bunch of functionality built with languages I didn't understand.  A lot of them didn't have the functions I wanted for my guild at the time which is what prompted me to become a developer and actually "learn" coding instead of just interations of manipulating things that other people were doing. Nvybot is my new-to-bot-building love child. <3
